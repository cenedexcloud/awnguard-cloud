      category: "Awning Cleaning",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "How often should awnings be cleaned?",
          answer: "We recommend professional awning cleaning at least twice a year for most properties. High-traffic commercial areas or properties near trees may benefit from quarterly cleaning."
        },
        {
          question: "What types of awnings can you clean?",

      category: "Solar Panel Cleaning",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "Why should I clean my solar panels?",
          answer: "Dirty solar panels can lose up to 25% of their efficiency. Dust, pollen, bird droppings, and other debris block sunlight from reaching the photovoltaic cells, reducing energy production and your return on investment."
        },
        {
          question: "How often should solar panels be cleaned?",
          answer: "We recommend cleaning solar panels 2-4 times per year, depending on your location and environmental factors. Areas with high dust, pollen, or bird activity may require more frequent cleaning."
        },
        {
          question: "Will cleaning void my solar panel warranty?",
          answer: "No! Our cleaning methods are manufacturer-approved and specifically designed for solar panels. We use gentle techniques that won't void your warranty."
        },

          question: "Do you clean both residential and commercial solar panels?",

        },
        {
          question: "What's your cleaning method for solar panels?",
          answer: "We use purified water, soft brushes, and gentle techniques to safely clean your panels without harsh chemicals or pressure washing. We finish with a deionized water rinse to prevent water spots."
